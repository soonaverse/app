# Contributing to Soonaverse

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

SOON token is used to reward contributors for their effort.

## SOON token Rewards

All contributions are rewarded through SOON tokens. Yes, your contribution is valued.

Current code review committee: 
- @adam_unchained
- @flyingrabbit-lab

Core reviewer labels appropriate category on the PR or github issue. If no category is defined on either of them make sure to ask code reviewer by tagging them. SOON reward can be discussed prior on the Github issue before the work even starts. This allows interested parties to understand potential reward.

There are three categories of contribution:

**Category 1 (up to 1000 SOON):**

- Requires one approval on PR by code review committee member.

**Category 2 (up to 5000 SOON):**

- Requires one approval on PR by code review committee member.
- Requires majority SOON Committee approval.

**Category 3 (unrestricted):**

- Requires one approval on PR by code review committee member.
- Requires majority SOON Committee approval.
- Requires SOON vote through Soonaverse on-chain votting.

Please note, contributor is responsible to notify and reach out to members for approval.

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Submit the pull request picking "develop" as the base branch.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/soonaverse/app/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
